# Advanced CS and JS Topics

Today you will work with a group to learn and discuss four main topics found in Computer Science and Javascript. Those topics are: Hoisting, Recursion, Big O Notation, and Sorting Algorithms. The resources below are meant to give you an introductory overview of these concepts, not to gain a full mastery of them. With your group, go through the resources below and then discuss the questions attached to each section.
